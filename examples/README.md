# @bridge-tools/generator examples

The benchmarks and examples are best run in a new `npm` repository, installing this package as a dependency with `npm i @bridge-tools/generator`. To run the examples within the repository itself it may be necessary to change `require('@bridge-tools/generator')` to `require('../../dist')`.

-   `example1` - Generate a single deal and print out it's hands. Run in node.
-   `example2` - Same as example1, but setup with `browserify` to be able to be run in a browser.
-   `example3` - Generate 10 deals where North is 4=4=3=2.
